The “Game of Pods” is a set of fun challenges that can help students get started learning Kubernetes and to practice real world examples of cloud native application deployment on a real Kubernetes cluster.

To play, once the terminal is loaded, open the challenge/quiz portal by clicking on the tab at the top.

You will receive a quest to deploy a web server architecture stack for a particular software distribution, for example: Drupal with MySQL.

Set up an example volume with storage allocation for the partition with the code:

Volume Name: drupal-mysql-pv
  Storage: 5Gi
  Access modes: ReadWriteOnce
  
In order to do this, Create the persistent storage volume for Drupal on the web server cluster using YAML:

master $ cat > drupal-mysql-pv.yaml
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
   name: drupal-mysql-pv
  spec:
   accessModes: [ “ReadWriteOnce” ]
   capacity:
   storage: “5Gi”
   hostPath:
   path: /drupal-mysql-data
  master $
  
Then test your work by clicking on the “Check” button in the game-board.
